### Netflix-TMDB

This project was developed as a personal challenge to test and improve my React skills. Inspired by Netflix's interface, the goal was to recreate its aesthetics and functionality while integrating the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display real movie data.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Movie Lists:** Displays movies organized by categories such as trending, top-rated, and specific genres, powered by the TMDB API.
- **Interactive UI:** A clean, responsive, and visually appealing design inspired by Netflix's user experience.
- **Scalable Codebase:** Well-structured architecture, following best practices for code organization and performance optimization.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern front-end development techniques and the creation of interfaces that combine usability with professional design.
